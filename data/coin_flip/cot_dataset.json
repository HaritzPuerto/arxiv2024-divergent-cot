If one of them flipped heads and the other flipped tails, then the coin is no longer heads up. But if both of them flipped heads, then the coin is still heads up.\n\nStep 6: Since the number of flips is even and there are two possible outcomes for each flip, there are a total of 4 possible outcomes.

If it lands tails up, the total number of heads up flips is 1, which is an odd number.\nStep 3: Elanah flips the coin. If it lands heads up, the total number of heads up flips is even (since 2 + 1 = 3, which is odd). If it lands tails up, the total number of heads up flips is odd (since 2 + 0 = 2, which is even).\nStep 4: Based on the total number of heads up flips after both Kunotas and Elanah flip the coin, we can determine whether the coin is still heads up.\n\nSo the answer is: it depends on how the coin lands after Kunotas flips it.

The coin has been flipped twice, which is an even number (once by Stonewall and once by Sri). We know that when a coin is flipped an even number of times, the result is the same as the initial state.
